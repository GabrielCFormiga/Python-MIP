## From Model to Solution: Mastering Optimization with Python-MIP
---

Welcome to "Mastering Optimization with Python-MIP".

First of all, I would like to thank the excellent professor Teobaldo Bulhões — perhaps the best I have had at university, not for theoretical depth, but for his ability to explain a concept simply without losing its essence, something I greatly admired in great minds like Richard Feynman. He was my professor in the Operations Research course at UFPB and introduced me to Python-MIP.

Getting to the point, this repository contains a collection of optimization problem models using Python-MIP and marks my learning journey.

I hope it can serve as a guide for those who wish to learn and apply optimization techniques in their own Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Problems projects.
