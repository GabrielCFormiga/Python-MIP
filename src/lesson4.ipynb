    "### Problem Description\n",
    "The Better Products Company has decided to start producing four new products using three factories that currently have excess production capacity. The products require a comparable production effort per unit, so the available production capacity of the factories is measured by the number of units of any product that can be produced daily, as shown in Table 1. Table 2 provides the daily production rate required to meet projected sales. Each factory is capable of producing any of these products, except Factory 2, which cannot manufacture product 3. The variable costs per unit of each product differ from factory to factory, as shown in Table 3.\n",
